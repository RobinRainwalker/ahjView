This website is a database of solar industry permitting information for North East towns and cities. The stack is React/Rails/Bootstrap and requires no installation. This project is a concept design website showcasing a specific functionality for a small piece of a larger project - a full scale solar CRM. It is meant to record town/city information necessary to apply for building and electrical permits for solar installation projects. 

Search, mobile and optimization are the next three major tasks to be completed but the site is currently fully functional.
